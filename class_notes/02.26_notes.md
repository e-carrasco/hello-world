- OOP:  
        - Encapsulation How you organize data into classes,  
        - Abstraction simplification of a process,  
        - Polymorphism Able to use objects from one type with another,  
        - Inheritence Parent -> Child
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) in charge of handling runtime environment for .class files
- Stack - functions, variables
- Heap - stores objects, and heap is shared between all threads
- Compiled?

Java bean: a class that has data and getters and setters to the data
new keyword: creates an object of specified type

constructor has invisible line example:

public Constructor_of_class(){
        super(); //this line is normally invisible
}

call another constructor within a constructor:

public constructor_of_class(){
        this("not default"); //calls another constructor
}
