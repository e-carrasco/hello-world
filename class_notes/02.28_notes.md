# Java Core Functionality

## Abstraction
- abstract
- interface

## Polymorphism
- method overloading -compile time
- overriding - runtime
- covariant types (Super A = new sub();)

## Inheritance
- extends
- implements

## Encapsulation
- private instance
- getters and setters
- aka accessors and mutators



# Throwable
Things that can go wrong during the normal operation of a program

## Error

- we don't handle these, avoid as best as possible
- ex: StackOverflow, OutOfBounds
## Exception

- checked and unchecked
- runtime are unchecked (NFE, IOOBE)
- compiletime are checked
- checked: if a method **throws** a checked exception, any code calling that method, must handle (**catch** or return) the exception ex: IOException, SQLException
- runtime: do *not* have to handle them (but should if likely) originally from programming errors ex: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

## Exception Handling
Keywords: **try, catch, finally, throw, throws**

-> exception is ***thrown*** when something goes wrong, we can either ***catch*** it, or ***throw*** it to whatever method is calling the current method which throws the exception.

ex:
... main(){  
        // do stuff here  
}

doThings(){  
        try{  
                //risky code here that may throw exception   
        } catch (EXCEPTION_TYPE_HERE <Variable_name>) {  
                //exception handling goes here  
        } finally { } //optional if catch is present


## POJO 
Plain
Old
Java
Object

## Relationships between objects
- is - A : essentially inheritance ex. Human ***is a*** Animal
- has - A : internal variables within an object ex. Human ***has a*** String head


## Collection
- List
- Set
- Queue
